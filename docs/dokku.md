# docs/dokku.md

This page is not intended as full documentation of dokku setup; for that, please see: 

* <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/dokku/>

Instead, this is a quick guide to setting up a `proj-courses` 
instance on dokku that assumes you are already familiar with the basic operation of dokku, and just need a "cheat sheet" to 
get up and running quickly.

Throughout, we use `courses` as the appname.  Substitute any other appropriate name, e.g. `courses-qa`, `courses-dev-cgaucho`, `courses-pr235` as needed.

The lines in the instructions where you need to modify something are marked with the comment: `# modify this`

* For the values of `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` see [docs/oauth.md](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/proj-courses/blob/main/docs/oauth.md)
* For the value of `UCSB_API_KEY` see: [UCSB Developer API overview](https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/apis/apis_ucsb_developer_api.html)
* For the values of `START_QTR` and `END_QTR` use whatever values you choose (first four digits are year, last digit is 1=Winter, 2=Spring, 3=Summer, 4=Fall), however make sure that
  `START_QTR <= END_QTR`, and that `END_QTR` is a quarter for which data is available, which you can check quickly [here](https://my.sa.ucsb.edu/public/curriculum/coursesearch.aspx)
* Set `SOURCE_REPO` to be the url of your teams' repo (i.e. replace the team name in the example below) 

The other line you can copy/paste as is, except for changing `courses` to whatever your app name will be (e.g. `courses-qa`, `courses-dev-cgaucho`, `courses-pr235`).
